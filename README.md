This is the base project for the term projects of the Database Management Systems course at the Istanbul Technical University, Computer Engineering Department.

Project name is BeeLink. Link is : http://itucsdb1608.mybluemix.net/

The term projects are Python web applications that use a PostgreSQL database. Projects must use the Flask framework. The necessary libraries for Project are already included in this project.

If you will use another database, you have to add it to your project files and the classpath.

This project can be directly imported into Eclipse. You can start the application by running the "Server.py" file as a regular Python application.
